## My Process

I started out with mapping in my mind the various components for the page and what components would be client component or server components.

### Built with

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- [ShadCN](https://www.shadcn.com)
- [Lucide Icons](https://lucide.dev/icons)

### What I learned

SInce this was my frist project with the NextJS framework, I learned:

- Thinking about how to structure files, directories

- Splitting components into client and server types

- Code modularity

### Continued Development

Since API calls were made with Axios, the made is not a SSG page, further changes would focus on caching and also adding more visually appealing features like skeletons, not found page and Error pages
